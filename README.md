# Classification-of-Text-Documents-using-Naive-Bayes

In natural language processing and machine learning Naive Bayes is a popular method for classifying text documents. It can be used to classifies documents into pre defined types based on likelihood of a word occurring by using Bayes theorem. In this article we will implement Text Classification using Naive Bayes in Python.
